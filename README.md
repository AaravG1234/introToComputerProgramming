# Intro To Computer Programming Fall 2022
# Final Project

# Objective:
# Neural Network To Detect Pneumonia and Calculate Accuracy and Precision.

# What is pneumonia:
   1. Infection in the lung
   2. Causes approximately 2.5 million deaths annually.

# Data Setup :
   1. Datasets
   2. Data classification between normal and pneumonia test cases

# Baseline Models:
   1. Classifiers and Regression models for:
       a) separation of classes
       b) numbering of the nearest neighbors

# Neural Networking Models (determine and analyze visual imagery) :
   1. CNN Classifier
       a) Convolutional Neural Network
   2. Dense Classifier
       a) Vanilla Neural Network

# Maybe: Expert Model
   1. Compare with our neural network for standard of accuracy
